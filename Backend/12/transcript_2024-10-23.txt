Speaker 0 (Dentist): Hi there! Thanks for coming in today. I’ve taken a look at your panoramic X-ray. How have you been feeling?

Speaker 1 (Patient): Hi, Doctor. I’ve been having some trouble on both sides of my mouth. It’s mostly discomfort when I’m chewing, and I also have some missing teeth that I’m concerned about.

Speaker 0: Alright, let’s go through what I’m seeing on the X-ray. It looks like there are quite a few areas we need to address. First, let’s talk about the missing teeth, since I can see some gaps in the upper and lower arches.

Speaker 1: Yes, I lost those teeth years ago. I’ve been thinking about doing something to fill the gaps.

Speaker 0: I understand. The X-ray shows that you have some empty spaces where molars used to be, particularly on both lower sides. These gaps can impact your bite and cause extra wear on the remaining teeth. Have you considered options like implants or partial dentures?

Speaker 1: I’ve thought about it, but I wasn’t sure which option would be best.

Speaker 0: Both options can be effective, but they have different benefits. Implants are a more permanent solution, and they function much like natural teeth, preventing bone loss in the jaw over time. Partial dentures, on the other hand, are removable and a bit more affordable upfront. I can refer you to a specialist to discuss which option might suit you best.

Speaker 1: That makes sense. I’d like to learn more about implants since they’re more permanent.

Speaker 0: Good choice! Implants would fill in those spaces and stabilize your bite. We can set up a consultation with an oral surgeon to go over the implant procedure in detail.

Speaker 1: Sounds good. What else did you see on the X-ray?

Speaker 0: I also noticed a few remaining tooth roots in the lower jaw, specifically in the areas where some teeth were previously extracted. These roots are no longer functional, and they may need to be removed to prevent any potential infection.

Speaker 1: I didn’t know there were roots left behind. Is that common?

Speaker 0: It can happen, especially if the extraction was complicated or if the roots were particularly deep. They’re not necessarily a problem if they’re stable, but if they cause any pain or swelling, it would be best to have them removed.

Speaker 1: I haven’t noticed any pain from them so far, but I’ll keep an eye out.

Speaker 0: Perfect. Moving on, I can also see that some of the remaining teeth have experienced wear and potential bone loss around the roots, which might be due to gum disease. Have you noticed any bleeding or sensitivity in your gums?

Speaker 1: Yes, sometimes when I brush, I see a bit of bleeding, especially around the back teeth.

Speaker 0: That’s a sign that the gums may be inflamed. The X-ray shows some mild to moderate bone loss, which is often associated with periodontal disease. I’d recommend a deep cleaning, also called scaling and root planing, to remove any buildup below the gumline and to help prevent further bone loss.

Speaker 1: I’ll definitely do that. I wasn’t aware that bone loss could happen with gum disease.

Speaker 0: Yes, untreated gum disease can lead to bone loss, which weakens the support around the teeth. The deep cleaning will help, and maintaining good home care will also be important to stabilize the condition.

Speaker 1: I’ll make sure to be more diligent with my brushing and flossing.

Speaker 0: That’s great to hear. Lastly, there are a few areas where your teeth have shifted or tilted due to the missing teeth. This can affect your bite and make it harder to clean certain areas, leading to further plaque buildup. Once we address the missing teeth, it should help to correct your bite and prevent further shifting.

Speaker 1: I hadn’t noticed the shifting, but it makes sense. I can see how replacing the missing teeth would help.

Speaker 0: Absolutely. Replacing those teeth will provide more balance in your bite and help prevent further movement of your other teeth. So, to sum it all up, I’d recommend we start with a deep cleaning to address the gum inflammation, keep monitoring the remaining roots to ensure they stay stable, and consider an implant consultation to discuss filling in the missing spaces.

Speaker 1: That sounds like a solid plan. Thank you for explaining everything, Doctor.

Speaker 0: You’re very welcome. We’ll take it step by step, and I’m here to guide you through the entire process. Just let me know if you have any questions along the way.

Speaker 1: I appreciate it. I’ll go ahead and schedule that cleaning appointment soon.

Speaker 0: Great! I’ll see you soon, and we’ll make sure you’re back on track with a healthy smile.
