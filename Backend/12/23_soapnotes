  "subjective": "Patient reports discomfort, primarily on the lower left side of the mouth, attributed to a potentially problematic wisdom tooth.  They describe the pain as a dull ache that becomes sharper with chewing. There is no significant swelling reported.",
  "objective": "Panoramic X-ray reveals: \n- Impacted lower left wisdom tooth angled against the adjacent molar.  \n- Stable metal-based fillings present on lower molars.  \n- Multiple missing molars.  \n- Slight spacing between bone and molars, potentially indicating mild periodontal concerns.",
  "assessment": "1.  **Impacted lower left wisdom tooth:**  The impaction is likely the source of the patient's pain and poses a risk for inflammation, infection, and potential damage to the neighboring molar. \n2.  **Stable lower molar fillings:**  Although currently asymptomatic, these older fillings will require ongoing monitoring for wear, fractures, and recurrent decay. \n3.  **Missing molars:**  These missing teeth have the potential to cause bite misalignment, shifting of remaining teeth, and bone loss, impacting long-term oral health. \n4.  **Mild periodontal concerns:**  The observed bone spacing suggests the beginnings of periodontal disease, requiring careful monitoring and emphasis on home hygiene.",
  "plan": "1.  **Wisdom Tooth:**  Referral to an oral surgeon for evaluation and likely extraction of the impacted lower left wisdom tooth to prevent further complications. \n2.  **Lower Molar Fillings:**  Continue monitoring the condition of the existing fillings during regular checkups and discuss replacement options if necessary.  \n3.  **Missing Molars:**  Discuss tooth replacement options with the patient, including dental implants or a bridge, explaining the benefits of each for preserving bone structure and bite alignment.  \n4.  **Periodontal Health:**  Encourage meticulous oral hygiene practices, including proper brushing and flossing techniques, to maintain gum health and prevent further bone loss.  Periodontal health will be monitored closely at subsequent appointments."
