Speaker 0: Thanks for coming in today.
Speaker 0: I have reviewed your panoramic x-ray, and I can see a few things that I'd like to discuss with you.
Speaker 0: Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort in your jaw or teeth?
Speaker 0: Yes.
Speaker 1: Actually, I've been feeling some discomfort
Speaker 1: the right side.
Speaker 1: Especially when I chew,
Speaker 1: It's been getting worse lately.
Speaker 0: That makes sense. Looking at this x-ray, I can see some dental
Speaker 0: issues that might be contributing to your discomfort. There
Speaker 0: appears to be a few areas with dental decay and some bone loss, which could be affecting the stability of your teeth.
Speaker 0: It looks like you also have some older fillings in dental work.
Speaker 1: Who are c?
Speaker 1: What would you recommend for treatment?
Speaker 0: Well, I'd suggest a few options based on what I'm seeing here.
Speaker 0: First, it's important to address any decay or damage to prevent further bone loss.
Speaker 0: We can look into options like
Speaker 0: fillings or crowns to protect the teeth.
Speaker 0: For the areas where you have significant bone loss, a bone graft could help to restore the bone density.
Speaker 0: Which could stabilize your teeth.
Speaker 1: How long would the recovery be for something like a bone graft
Speaker 0: The recovery time varies, but, typically, it takes a few months for the graph to integrate with your
Speaker 0: existing bone. During that time, we'll monitor the progress with follow-up x rays and checkups.
Speaker 0: You might experience some soreness initially, but we'll provide medication to manage any discomfort.
Speaker 1: Okay. That sounds manageable.
Speaker 1: What else would you recommend? We should also keep
Speaker 0: a close eye on your gum health as inflammation can lead to further bone loss.
Speaker 0: Regular cleanings and potentially some periodontal treatments could help.
Speaker 0: Additionally, replacing any old fillings that show wear could prevent future issues.
Speaker 1: Thank you for explaining everything.
Speaker 1: It sounds like there are 2 steps.
Speaker 1: But I want to make sure I don't get any more problems.
Speaker 1: Should I show you an appointment for the first treatment soon?
Speaker 0: That's a good idea. We can start with the thorough cleaning and then plan the fillings or groundwork.
Speaker 0: Afterwards, we can discuss the graft procedure. Let's schedule the first appointment, and I'll have my
Speaker 0: assistant go over the timeline and details with you.
