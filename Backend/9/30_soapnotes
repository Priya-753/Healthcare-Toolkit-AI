  "plan": "1. Monitor existing restorations during routine checkups for any signs of wear and tear or recurrent decay. 2. Emphasize the importance of regular dental cleanings and checkups to maintain oral health and prevent decay around existing restorations. 3. Recommend regular flossing and brushing along the gum line to prevent periodontal disease and potentially mitigate further bone loss.  4. Monitor areas of mild bone loss in future appointments to assess for any progression and adjust treatment plan as needed."
